- FEATURE: Rideable mobs can move through leaves when ridden, at a lower speed ( by default 85% of the original speed)

#### Exploration

- FEATURE: Map Book, craftable with an empty map and a book on a cartography table, in which you can add maps by adding the desired map and the mapbook on your inventory's crafting grid
